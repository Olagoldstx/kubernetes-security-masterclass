# 🔐 Docker Security Fundamentals
## Container Fortress Foundations

## 🎯 Why Docker Security Matters
**Containers are the building blocks of our Kubernetes fortress*
- Insecure containers = Weak castle foundations
- Docker security = Strong building materials
- Image vulnerabilities = Structural weaknesses

## 🏰 Analogy: Castle Building Materials
- **Docker Images** = Bricks and mortar
- **Container Runtime** = Construction techniques  
- **Image Scanning** = Quality control inspections
- **Minimal Images** = Lightweight, strong materials

## 📋 Docker Security Labs
1. **Lab 1.D.1** - Secure Image Building
2. **Lab 1.D.2** - Container Vulnerability Scanning
3. **Lab 1.D.3** - Runtime Security Best Practices

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running
- Basic Docker knowledge
- Understanding of container concepts

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Verify Docker installation
docker --version
docker run hello-world

# Check security settings
docker info | grep -A 10 Security
```

**Let's secure our container foundations!** 🛡️
