# LAB 2.2: Ingress Security & TLS - Castle Gate Defenses

## 🎯 Lab Objectives
1. Secure external access with Ingress
2. Implement TLS termination
3. Configure path-based routing security

## 🏰 Analogy: Castle Gate Defenses
The main castle gate (Ingress) needs strong defenses:
- **TLS/SSL** = Encrypted messages (sealed scrolls)
- **Path routing** = Direct visitors to correct castle areas
- **Rate limiting** = Control visitor flow
