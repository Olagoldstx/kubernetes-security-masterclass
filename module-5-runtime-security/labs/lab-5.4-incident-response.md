# LAB 5.4: Incident Response & Forensics
## Castle Emergency Response Procedures

## üéØ Lab Objectives
1. Establish incident response procedures
2. Implement forensic evidence collection
3. Create incident communication protocols
4. Develop post-incident improvement processes

## üè∞ Analogy: Castle Emergency Protocols
- **Incident Response** = Emergency guard mobilization
- **Forensics** = Crime scene investigation
- **Communication** = Emergency signal systems
- **Improvement** = Castle defense upgrades

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Implementation

### Step 1: Create Incident Response Plan
```yaml
# incident-response-plan.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: incident-response-plan
  namespace: security
data:
  response-plan: |
    # Kubernetes Security Incident Response Plan
    
    ## Phase 1: Detection & Analysis
    - Monitor Falco alerts and Kubernetes events
    - Triage security incidents by severity
    - Gather initial evidence and context
    
    ## Phase 2: Containment
    - Isolate affected pods and namespaces
    - Block malicious network traffic
    - Revoke compromised credentials
    
    ## Phase 3: Eradication & Recovery
    - Remove malicious artifacts
    - Restore from clean backups
    - Implement security patches
    
    ## Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity
    - Conduct root cause analysis
    - Update security controls
    - Document lessons learned
```
